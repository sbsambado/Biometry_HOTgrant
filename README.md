This repository is for the re-structuring of the Biometry course computer labs in the Ecology Department at UC Santa Barbara. This work was awarded to S Sambado and C J Briggs and supported by a Hybrid, Online, and Technology Teaching Grant from UCSB. 

**Goals for restructuring**
1. Creating supplemental Exercise file to address learning needs of most students
2. Streamlined Homework file for easier grading
3. Update material to reflect broader interests of students (i.e. all biological systems) and include concepts of data sovereignty and environmental data justice 
4. Revising content to reduce cheating from previous lab assignments
   
**Lab material**
+ Lab 1 – Biometry Basics in RMarkdown
+ Lab 2 – Intro to Data Wrangling & Analysis
+ Lab 3 – Visualizing Data & Identifying Distributions
+ Lab 4 – Comparing Mean with Parametric Tests
+ Lab 5 – Comparing Means with Non-Parametric Tests
+ Lab 6 – Analysis of Variance Across Groups
+ Lab 7 – Correlation & Linear Regression
+ Lab 8 – Multiple Linear Regression & Model Selection
+ Lab 9 – Other Common Ecological Statistics in Research
